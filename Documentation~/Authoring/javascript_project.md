# JavaScript Project

## Introduction

This document provides information on some advanced functionality for the use of JavaScript files for Cloud Code. 

JavaScript projects for Cloud Code work by turning the Unity project into a NodeJS project. That is used as a bridge and allows us to control the editor that is being used for JavaScript. 

## Structure

```
.
├── Assets
│   └── CloudCode
│       └── cloud_script.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
```

The root of the structure sits at the root of the Unity Project. 

`package.json` stores the project configuration. This is used by JS editors and NPM. It operates similar to how CSProj is used by C# to define info for the editor. Note that these `package.json` files used within the JavaScript Project system are not Unity packages. They are NPM Packages. It is a coincidence that Unity and NodeJS use the same package management system under the hood. 

`package-lock.json` is generated by npm and used for dependency resolution. It is recommended to keep this file in source control so that dependencies will always be resolved the same way.

## NodeJS
In order to support more tooling for developers, we require devs to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will allow support for AutoComplete and other expected features of a dev environment.

## AutoComplete

The majority of autocomplete for JS is handled by the [typings](https://github.com/typings/registry) project. Any JavaScript file can be augmented using a `.d.ts` files to define the typed API. Most public JS libraries either include their own `.d.ts` files or have some defined within typings. 

In order for an editor to enable autocomplete for a dependency, it needs to be able to locate the type definitions for the dependency. It does this by looking in `node_modules`. So in order to enable autocomplete you need to use the `package.json` to install the correct files to `node_modules`. 

## External Tools

External tools can be added by running the appropriate `npm install ...` command from within the JS project. The tools can then be setup normally following the official tool guidelines. 

### ESLint

- Run `npm i -D eslint`. This will add it to the project dependencies.
- Create an `.eslint.json` file at the project root containing:
```json
{
    "env": {
        "commonjs": true,
        "es2021": true
    },
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 13
    },
    "rules": {
    }
}
```
- Configure your IDE to run eslint. This is automatic for VSCode but may need additional settings depending on the IDE. 
- Eslint should now be configured and working

To test that eslint is working, add some code that is valid but breaks the `eslint:recommended` ruleset. For example `if (something == -0)` should now show a eslint warning in your IDE.

### Jest
Jest is a framework for JavaScript testing. This is one example of how you can create unit tests for your cloud code scripts.

Official website: https://jestjs.io/
 
#### Setup
- Run `npm install --save-dev jest`. This will install the jest package.
- Configure jest to run with `.es10` scripts.
  - Add this code snippet to your `package.json`
  - The `moduleFileExtensions` entry will make `js` and `es10` files valid for testing.
  - The `testMatch` entry will make files ending in `.test.es10` valid as test files.
  
```
"jest": {
    "moduleFileExtensions": ["es10", "js"],
    "testMatch": ["**/*.test.es10"]
  }
```
#### Example
Here's a simple example for JS unit testing. We are returning an object and want to make sure the result in the test script is the same. More advanced options are available with mocking.

##### The script to be tested
Cloud code expects this signature.
``` 
module.exports = async ({ params, context, logger }) => {
  return {value: "1"};
};
```
##### The test script
```
const test = require("./jest_01.es10")
it("test",async () =>{
    expect(await test({})).toMatchObject({value:"1"});
});
```

#### Running your tests
Your tests can be run in command line with the following command `npm run test`
